<strong>Ingredients</strong>

        <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 handfull of delicious mozarella cheese</li>
    <ul>
<p> </p>

<strong>Directions</strong>
    <ol> 
        <li>
            <p>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until</p>
            <p>well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.</p>
            <p>Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and</p>
            <p>2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling</p>
            <p>water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl,</p>
            <p>combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking</p>
            <p>dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the</p>
            <p>ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups</p>
            <p>meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat</p>
            <p>layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to</p>
            <p>prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not</p>
            <p>touch the cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25</p>
            <p>minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        </li>
